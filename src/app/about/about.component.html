  <h1>About this project</h1>

  <p>
    This project is a result of the Angular assignment from Better. It showcases
    a simple application that displays a list of doctors and their tasks. The
    application was generated with Angular CLI version 17.3.1. and was built
    using Angular and Angular Material. The data for the doctors and tasks is
    fetched from the JSONPlaceholder API.
